# Atom Dark Solarized theme for VSCode

Atom diehard fan color theme for VSCode. Combines
Atom Dark like interface with Solarized Dark syntax.

Heavily based on Ryan Olson's awesome https://github.com/ryanolsonx/vscode-solarized-theme

Theme primarily optimized for JavaScript and Markdown syntax but looks good enough
with other grammars too.

## Screenshots
